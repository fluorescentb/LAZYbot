Welcome to the House Chess Variants Community Discord Server!
Discord provides a chat server for members of your variants community to congregate and chat, discussing games, offering help, playing games, betting, and organising matches.
Super simple, we try and keep it casual round here.

**1) Use the right channel for the right topic please.**
#general and #off-topic are you homes, as are your specific channel for the variant you play! Don't spam in anything outside of #gambling, and if you want to discuss bets, go to #betting. Ask if you need any help!

**2) Don't be a dick.**
Ez one: don't incite drama, if you have a problem, present arguments, not attacks. Keep personal insults to a minimum, don't bitch, and don't become Channel 24.
 
**3) Don't spam.**
Except in #spam. The server is a place for discussion of chess variants. Nobody should have their computer or phone lagged or be constantly pinged because someone wants to fill the chat with one-word messages.

**4) Don't delete the server.**
^As written

**How do we enforce these?**
@mods do with whatever actions they feel like. You'll probably get `.warning` for first offences, and you might get deducted House currency (: :cherry_blossom: ). Repeat violations and explicitly ignoring mod instructions will get you kicked.

If there's an issue, please PM one of the mods!
__**MAIN**__

Most of these channels are hidden right now! You can see:
#welcome: Bienvenue, bienvenido, and ciao. We hope you have a good time.
#announcements: Where we put server updates. We get new features pretty quickly.
#role-assignment Assign yourself roles here! Simply react with the appropriate emoji to get a role.
#join: Where one of our  members will probably say hi to you. It may be helpful to share your lichess/site username.

The other channels are where the majority of our chat takes place. Head to #role-assignment to view these.
#general : Discuss the server here. Anything about variants, tournaments, players, server suggestions, any chat.
#off-topic: Discuss anything else! Economics is a particularly popular subject. LAZY likes philosophy.
#chess: Discussion of boring ol' chess games. They'll probably be world championship and OTB chat here.
#live: Updates for our server members who are streamers go here. If you see a :arrow_forward: here, someone's streaming.
#house-party-channel-voice :champagne: :tada:
