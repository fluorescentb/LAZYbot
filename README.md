# LAZYmail

Discord bot operating intuitive mod-mail features without dependency on a database. Inspired by new Reddit mod-mail functionality

In use in the [IB Discord Server](https://discord.gg/IBO) where it services over 13,800 members [March 2019].

Bot has moved to be a branch of LAZYbot but with the commands handler modified so that the active commands on the bot is greatly reduced. The actual source files containing all the usual modules compared to [LAZYbot](https://github.com/theLAZYmd/LAZYbot) are all still present, they are just not called, therefore not affecting run-time.

This branch will update from master as updates to LAZYbot come in.
